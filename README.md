  "How do we get great designers?
  Great designers design,
  of course."
                          Fred Brooks

  "So how are we supposed to get great architects, if
  they only get the chance  to architect fewer than
  a half-dozen times in their career?"

                         Ted Neward

## About

Architectural Katas are intended as a small-group (3-5 people) exercise, usually as part of a larger group (4-10 groups are ideal), each of whom is doing a different kata. A Moderator keeps track of time, assigns Katas (or allows this website to choose one randomly), and acts as the facilitator for the exercise.
